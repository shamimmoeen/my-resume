The job responsibility is developing WordPress plugins and which I think I am good at and love to do.

I released my first WordPress plugin in 2015. There are total 5 plugins in wordpress.org developed by me. I developed around 50 custom plugins for my Upwork clients.

I was in love for PHP, it was easy to learn, this is why I started my career with it. In the beginning, I created a website using raw php without using any framework or library. While working for that project I became fluent in PHP and started to make custom WordPress themes.

I started JavaScript since 2018 when I started learning React. I developed the backend ui for one of my plugin using React and Gutenberg components. 

I learned HTML and CSS from w3schools. I always try to use HTML5 and CSS3 as they come out.

I had to use PayPal Rest API to integrate the payment system in my first project that I developed using Raw PHP. I used Google Calendar API in a WordPress Booking Plugin to sync the appointments. I used Google Map API to show map, markers, used Distance Matrix API to calculate the distances and filter the places.

I've been a part-time remote WordPress developer for a French client for the past 8 years. Additionally, I recently completed a successful 3-month contract as a full-time remote WordPress developer for Kings Crest Global in Spain.

The most important things to consider for remote works as per mine are on-time communication, dedicated office space, self discipline.

This strong foundation made it easy for me to move on to building custom WordPress themes and plugins.

I have used Maps JavaScript API to display interactive maps with markers and implemented the Distance Matrix API to calculate distances and filter locations.
